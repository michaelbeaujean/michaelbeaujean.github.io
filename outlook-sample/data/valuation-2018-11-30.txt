S&P 500 Index	2.07	1.46	0.498518196	U.S. equities have outperformed for an extended period, but investors shouldn’t be too optimistic. Economic growth looks set to slow at a time when the Federal Reserve is tightening monetary policy, the U.S. dollar is strengthening and fiscal policy stimulus is peaking.
MSCI Europe Index	1.16	1.11	0.114613883	While compelling valuation opportunities exist in Europe at a time when the European Central Bank is lending a helping hand, slowing growth means that it could take more time to unlock the potential reward embedded in share prices.
MSCI EM Index	1.14	1.15	0.130149128	Trade wars, investor caution, flight-to-safety flows and falling currencies have caused EM stocks to deviate far below levels justified by generally stable fundamentals. However, our thesis of attractive valuations plus strong economic growth hasn’t changed.
US IG	0.44	0.56	-0.237195786	U.S. bonds remain expensive by historical standards despite the Fed's gradual rate hike path in 2018. Investors seeking income will likely be better served by looking outside of the United States to international and emerging market bonds for total return opportunities in 2019.
International	0.48	0.4	0.106639839	International developed-market bonds are slightly cheap relative to history. While interest rates remain very low in most developed world countries like Germany and Japan, investors can still find higher real yields abroad. Developed market credit, particularly from corporations in Europe, also still provides attractive opportunities for fixed income investors.
Emerging Markets 	3.9	3.77	0.044692737	Emerging market bonds still look cheap to their long-term averages, offering good income and total return opportunities for investors. Despite near-term headwinds related to a stronger U.S. dollar, emerging market sovereign and corporate borrowers remain in good health.
