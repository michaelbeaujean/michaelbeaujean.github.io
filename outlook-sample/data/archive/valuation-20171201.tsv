Economic growth is slowing at a time when the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates, and equity valuations are well above their long-term average.  Moreover, a lack of progress on the fiscal policy front limits the growth outlook."MSCI Europe Index	1.25	1.11	0.15	"We favor European equities as we see improving forward earnings growth alongside a brightening macroeconomic backdrop. Moreover, monetary policy remains accommodative."MSCI EM Index	1.38	1.14	0.24	"Emerging market equities, buoyed by robust Chinese growth, look attractive relative to U.S. equities.  While emerging market equity valuations are slightly above their long-term average, they remain compelling relative to U.S. equity valuations."US IG	0.35	0.55	-0.2	"US Bonds have reached expensive levels on a valuation basis after seeing interest rates remain flat in the US during 2017. With global yields low, income oriented investors may be better served looking outside of the United States."International	0.32	0.4	-0.08	International bonds are only slightly overvalued relative to their long-term history. Much of the developed world also has very low yields on their sovereign bonds. International bonds are still a good source of diversification due to being denominated in currencies other than the dollar.Emerging Markets 	3.56	3.3	0.26	"Emerging market bonds still look cheap to their long-term averages. Higher yields, better fundamentals and diverse currency exposures are all reasons we favor emerging market bonds currently despite recent inflows."
